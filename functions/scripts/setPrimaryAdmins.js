/**
 * scripts/setPrimaryAdmins.js
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * One-time setup script: marks the two named users as PRIMARY
 * admins (isPrimaryAdmin: true) and makes sure they also carry
 * an admin-level `role`, so they pass the site's normal isAdmin()
 * checks too.
 *
 * This talks to Firestore with the Admin SDK, so it bypasses
 * security rules entirely — that's expected for a one-time bootstrap
 * (there's no primary admin yet to approve the first ones!). Run it
 * once, then all future primary-admin changes go through the normal
 * 2-primary-admin-approval flow in the admin dashboard.
 *
 * SETUP (Application Default Credentials — no downloadable key needed;
 * use this if your org blocks service account key creation):
 *   1. Install the gcloud CLI, then run:
 *        gcloud auth application-default login
 *      Sign in with a Google account that has Owner/Editor access on
 *      the Firebase project. This stores credentials locally on your
 *      machine only — nothing to keep track of or gitignore.
 *   2. gcloud config set project unscripted-website
 *   3. cd functions && npm install
 *   4. node scripts/setPrimaryAdmins.js
 *
 * ALTERNATE SETUP (if your org allows key creation): drop a
 * downloaded service account JSON at
 * functions/scripts/serviceAccountKey.json and this script will use
 * it automatically instead.
 *
 * Matches users by the exact `name` field already stored on their
 * `users/{uid}` document (the same field shown on the Members page).
 * If a name below doesn't match anyone (typo, or the account hasn't
 * signed up yet), the script prints a warning and skips it — it
 * never guesses.
